Unofficial AtlasOS Installation Guide, because who likes the official one anyway?

:::caution

\- Can I get an Atlas ISO?  
\- NO, and we do not care if you are too stupid to install the new version.

:::

## What you will need

- A computer (duh)
- [AME Wizard](https://download.ameliorated.io/AME%20Wizard%20Beta.zip)
- [Atlas Playbook](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/releases/latest/download/Atlas_W10-22H2.zip)
- 64-bit CPU (A fairly recent computer)

## Downloading an ISO

An ISO is a thingy that you can use to install Windows on your computer.

- Open [MSDL](https://massgrave.dev/msdl/#2618) AND DON'T USE UUPDUMP OR ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S SHIT
- Select your language
- Click `IsoX64 Download` (this has to be X64 or your computer will burst into flames)

## Preparing AtlasOS

:::info

Some network adapters do not have drivers that come with Windows. So if that happens to you, you can give up and sit in a corner and cry.  
Or you can download the drivers from the manufacturer's website **before installing Atlas** and install them later...

:::

Once you have all the necessary files, you need to put them somewhere so you can use them while offline.

For example you can use a USB stick or you could create a temporary partition on your hard drive but you are probably too stupid to do that, so just go with the USB.

## Reinstalling Windows

Wait, why do I need to reinstall Windows?

Good question.

:::tip

Make a backup for your *important* files, because you **will** lose them with your luck and skill.  

But if you're lucky they will be placed in `C:\Windows.old` and you may be able to recover them :D

:::

1. Unplug your internet (yes)
2. Go to the ISO you downloaded and double click it to mount it, If it opens up in a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip, right click the ISO, click 'Open With' then open it with File Explorer.
3. Go to the drive that the ISO is mounted to and run `setup.exe` in the `sources` folder. TODO add screenshot, so the idiots can understand
4. Click `No thanks` when asked to apply updates, because you will update later. (also you have no internet if you didn't notice)
5. Click 'I don't have a product key', as Windows will activate its self (if you are currently activated) once you have finished installing.
6. Select the edition you want (Pro is recommended) but remember you have to stay legal so the feds don't come after you.
7. Accept the license terms, and click `Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)` to replace your current installation.
8. Find the C: drive, click next, click `OK` on the warning about `Windows.old` and wait for it to install.
9. Finish the installation in OOBE (the setup thingy that asks you to install Cortana and shit), follow the video attached:

10.  And now your windows should be installed :) (DON'T CONNECT TO INTERNET YET), Your old files should be in `Windows.old` folder
> To delete them go to `Settings -> System -> Storage`, then click `Temporary files`, select `Previous version of Windows` and then click `Remove files`.

## AtlasOS Installation (finally)
