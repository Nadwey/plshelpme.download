Unofficial AtlasOS Installation Guide, because who likes the official one anyway?

:::caution

\- Can I get an Atlas ISO?  
\- NO, and we do not care if you are too stupid to install the new version.

:::

## What you will need

- A computer (duh)
- [AME Wizard](https://download.ameliorated.io/AME%20Wizard%20Beta.zip)
- [Atlas Playbook](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/releases/latest/download/Atlas_W10-22H2.zip)
- 64-bit CPU (A fairly recent computer)

## Downloading an ISO

An ISO is a thingy that you can use to install Windows on your computer.

- Open [MSDL](https://massgrave.dev/msdl/#2618) AND DON'T USE UUPDUMP OR ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S SHIT
- Select your language
- Click `IsoX64 Download` (this has to be X64 or your computer will burst into flames)

### MSDL Download Tutorial (very hard)

## Preparing AtlasOS

:::info

Some network adapters do not have drivers that come with Windows. So if that happens to you, you can give up and sit in a corner and cry.  
Or you can download the drivers from the manufacturer's website **before installing Atlas** and install them later...

:::

Once you have all the necessary files, you need to put them somewhere so you can use them while offline.

For example you can use a USB stick or you could create a temporary partition on your hard drive but you are probably too stupid to do that, so just go with the USB.

## Reinstalling Windows

Wait, why do I need to install Windows?

Good question.
